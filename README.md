# mlda-course

It contains programming assignments I've done for [Machine Learning for Data Analysis](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-data-analysis) online course specialization.

The assignments are split by courses. In each course IPython notebooks're in chronological order, but also provided with some prefix, like `w2a` or `w1p`, which means _# of week_ and _kind of notebook_. There're 2 kinds of notebooks:

- `p` - practice, which is corresponding to notebooks from practical lectures with Emely - they don't contain any assignments.
- `a` - assignment, which is corresponding to notebooks with assignments.

The input data for notebooks is stored in `data/` subfolder of each course and output is in `out/` subfolder.

All notebooks are Python 3 compatible. Some notebooks are just my Kaggle practice, i.e. aren't from the courses.
